## Purpose

This project aims to develop an **exergame for stroke rehabilitation** that utilizes **hand gesture recognition** based on deep learning models (GRU).
The game is designed to support **home-based rehabilitation** by providing interactive physical exercises through gesture-controlled gameplay.

Research objectives:

1. Undergraduate Thesis development
2. Extension and improvement of prior research by **Sulistio (2025)**
3. Evaluation of deep learning models for hand gesture-based rehabilitation games

## Models Used

* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
* Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

The models are used to recognize hand gestures suitable for stroke patients, focusing on **MMT level 1–4**.

## Development Progress

### 11 September

* Created a new game map

### 15 September

* Game development improvements:

  * Camera zoom adjustment (larger view)
  * Added short tutorial
  * Added gameplay guide in main menu

### 2 October

* Added new levels (Level 3 to Level 8)

## Research Context

This project is part of an **experimental study** comparing deep learning models for hand gesture recognition in an exergame environment.
Multiple training iterations and parameter variations are applied to handle the **fluctuative nature of deep learning outputs**.
