# Exergame for Stroke Rehabilitation using LSTM-based Hand Gesture Recognition

- by Shabrina Al Khansa

## Purpose
1. Undergraduate Thesis
2. Creating an exergame that can be used for home rehabilitation


## Change log

3 June 2025: 
1. Resize the item (DONE)
2. Add fuction to handle collecting item target (objective) (DONE)
3. Add next level screen (DONE)
4. Add trial and level 2 (DONE)

4 June 2025:
1. Add debugging for gesture control

10 June 2025:
1. Add new model
2. Add hand gesture control

12 June 2025:
1. Add dwell time
2. Fix objective UI

## Improvement needed (4 June 2025)
1. Optional: fix tiles to center

## Notes
The hand gesture used in this exergame is based on stroke patients needs, focusing on MMT 3-5. Further development needed.
